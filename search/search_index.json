This is not a textbook. Focus of each note is to provide minimal, dense, clutterfree info for the reader to get started. Step 1: Setting up First you need to have a clean linux operating system setup. You can install Ubuntu 20.04 on VirtualBox or VMWare workstation if you have a laptop with 4-8GB RAM. Install Visual Studio Code or any other code editor you prefer. Install Git on your laptop. Sign up for an account on Github. Then setup SSH access. Step 2: Working locally Fork the original repository to your own account. Clone your forked repository to your laptop. Install python-virtualenv and setup a virtualenv with name 'venv' in the code folder. Activate the virtualenv and install the pip dependencies . Start the local development server with: mkdocs serve Step 3: Submit a pull request Open the folder in the editor. Understand how material for mkdocs works. Make edits in the docs folder to edit the contents. Navigate to your local deployment to test the changes. Keep making changes till you are satisfied. Then commit the changes . Push to your github account with git push . Navigate to the forked repository in your github account using your browser and submit a pull request to the original repository. Raise a github issue on the original repository , if you face any issues.","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"#getting-started","text":"This repository of notes is intended for quick reference, especially for beginners.

It's the psychic predecessor of all real understanding. An egoless acceptance of stuckness is a key to an understanding of all Quality, in mechanical work as in other endeavors. It's this understanding of Quality as revealed by stuckness which so often makes self-taught mechanics so superior to institute-trained men who have learned how to handle everything except a new situation. -- Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance (Robert M. Pirsig) This is where the real fun begins. Google Always, the first thing to do when stuck is ask google. Google for: error messages, keywords, describing the problem. Google in 5-6 different ways. Don't expect exact solutions. Look for posts that explain what is going on, so that you can understand enough to solve your issue. Stackoverflow results are most useful. Documentation sites next. Github issue discussions third. Finally personal blogs. Experiment As you keep learning more from googling, try experimenting on your own as well. Add print messages generously. This is the direct and most useful method. If you're on the browser, open developer tools and setup breakpoints. Try breaking your change into smaller changes and go step by step to see which step is the issue. Keep commits as small as possible. Even single lines. Test before every commit. So, that when you have an error, you have a smaller surface area for the bug to hide. When you are not sure what is happening under the hood, experiment to understand even if there is no bug. That understanding will pay disproportionately in the long run. Experimenting is the most fun way of learning things. Get out of the box Switch off for the day and start afresh the next day. Try to explain your problem to a friend. Just going over the problem again help see something you might have missed or come up with new ideas. Write a note on what got you stuck and the approaches you tried. Ask for help As a last effort, if you can't find any info through google and your own experiments haven't been insightful, you can ask for help.

If the output is something like Command 'python' not found,... then run sudo apt-get install python3 and follow the commands to get python installed in your system. pip - A tool for installing and managing Python packages To check if you already have pip installed run pip --version in the command line. If the output is something like pip 22.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.10) then you have pip installed, skip to MkDocs installation. If the output is something like Command 'pip' not found,... then first run sudo apt update then run sudo apt install python3-pip , confirm for the pip installation. MkDocs installation To install mkdocs run pip install mkdocs , to confirm the installation run mkdocs --version . Then you require to install material(theme of mkdocs used in the project). To install material run pip install mkdocs-material After this get the project setup locally with a virtualenv with name 'venv' in the project folder in your system. run mkdocs serve in the project directory to start a local development server. If you are able to see the project deployed then installation was successful. MkDocs' workflow In the project folder theres a docs folder which contains all the markdown files which are used to build the documentation, by convention docs/index.md is the homepage. The mkdocs.yml file contains all the project settings and its configurations site_name: Developer notes (required setting) - main title for the project documentation theme: name: material sets the theme and theme specific configuration of the documentation site. name: material name of known installed theme Learn more about theme .

How to add a note first check under which directory in docs you need to add the file, you can do so by checking the note's place in the site tree, which is mentioned in the nav: in the mkdocs.yml file. add and edit note_name.md in the proper directory and save it. test/preview the note run mkdocs serve it starts a local development server to see how the site will look published. after every edit just save your edits locally and the page auto-updates itself. publish once you are done making edits on the project you can publish the project on github pages, run mkdocs gh-deploy to do so. this will build the docs and commit them to gh-pages branch and push the gh-pages branch to GitHub and documentation should appear at <username>.github.io/<repository> .
